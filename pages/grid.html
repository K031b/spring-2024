        <p class="grid-2">There are other ways to be vocal.
            Silence becomes deafening.Defeating the purpose of awareness.
            Tempers quickly raise and often the things that aren't meant to be said come out.
            Echoing the loudest. Petty arguments, the excuses that lead us into the messages we're quick to hide.
            Despite how much time we've invested, the easiest thing to do is walk away.
            Anxiety becoming the fear that pushes us the furthest into ourselves.
            It's not always easy.</p>
        <p class="grid-2">When I think of you I can't help but grieve
            Maybe one day we will make up and reconcile
            I look about on the good times we spent together
            The conversations we had were wonderful and great
            I'm sorry we have to end it but its for the better
            Please don't think of me as filled with malice or hate
            </p>
        <p class="grid-2">I’ve loved you for longer than you’ve known and for far longer than you’ve deserved
            It’s my fault for loving you too much
            I knew you weren’t capable of accepting what I had to give
            But you didn’t have to make me feel stupid
            I can’t count the times you’ve brought tears to my eyes or have made me cry
            You’ve hurt my feelings so many times and I just want to know why
            If I could go back in time I’d try to be perfect for you just so you didn't make me feel so stupid</p>
